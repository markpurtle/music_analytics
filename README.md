Small personal music analytics projects


This repository contains a number a jupyter notebook files of music analytics projects I have carried out in my spare time.

ArcticMonkeysAnalytics.ipynb contains analysis on the audio properties of the Arctic Monkeys discography, such as valence, energy, danceability. Looking at
how they have varied over time, from album to album

Top100AlbumsAnalytics.ipynb contains analysis on the audio properties of best selling albums over time. Data of the best selling albums of each decade was 
scraped from Wikipedia pages and the Spotify API was used to gather audio features of these albums, which were then compared to see if they differed
over time and if they gave any indication of what features typically make up a best selling album.

These two projects were carried out so I could become familiar with how to use the Spotify API and because I found the concepts interesting.


Future work that I will carry out and upload to this repository is:
* A comprehensive analysis of my listening history on Spotify over the past year (as this is the
longest period Spotify allows me to download of my own listening history)

* An experiment on using machine learning for creating music listening suggestions when 
given a song

* Finally, I would like to attempt to synthesize music using GANs.
